The usage of LLMs has recently become mainstream. While most LLMs are free-for-use and open-sourced, best performing LLMs provided by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), [AlephAlpha](https://www.aleph-alpha.com/) charge users based on the amount of tokens passed into their API. 

This project aims to provide a cost estimation tool for LLMs. It is a simple web app that allows users to input prompt text and get an estimated cost of using LLMs to generate the text.
